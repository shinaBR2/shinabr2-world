# Intro

Welcome to the shinabr2-world wiki!

This documentation space (/docs) serves as the central knowledge repository for my internal project. Here contains comprehensive project-specific documentation covering everything from philosophical approaches to technical implementation details.

Documents are categorized into:

- [Philosophy](category/philosophy): The foundational principles, concepts, and mindsets that guide my project development and decision-making process.

- [Workflow](category/workflow): Detailed processes and procedures that ensure consistent and effective project execution, complementing my standard checklists.

- [How to Guide](category/how-to-guide): Practical implementation guides and instructions specifically tailored for project developers.

- [Technical Notes](category/technical-notes): A collection of development insights, including encountered challenges, current status updates, solutions, and important observations related to this project.

For broader topics beyond this project, please visit my blog section (/blog). The blog contains articles, insights, and other related subjects that aren't specifically tied to this project.
