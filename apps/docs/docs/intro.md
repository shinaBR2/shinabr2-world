# Daily tasks

Breaking down into a small piece of work is MUST for all features and tech debts.

Depends on the next thing I will work on (feature or tech debt):

- [Feature flow](https://github.com/shinaBR2/shinabr2-world/wiki/New-feature-workflow)
- Tech debt: it's a low priority, but needs to consider anyway.

Here are some questions to think about for tech debt, basically the situation determination.

- What happens if I don't do that?
- Is it regarding the data? If so, it's important.
- Does it block the user behavior? If so, it's important.
- Does it annoying to do daily tasks? If so, it needs to be fixed as soon as possible.
- Do I want to fix it just because I want to satisfy my feeling about clean code? If so, create an issue and do later.
