# Using encore-dev with Cloud Run

Few notes

- Cloud Run only allow to run API, does not support the dashboard because it's a serverless solution
- The dashboard is a tool build by encore platform with require a self-hosted infrastructure like VM or Kubernetes cluster

```
# RUN AT THE ROOT FOLDER

docker buildx create --driver docker-container --use

# Build and push into dockerhub
# Support multiple platform Linux and Mac M2
docker buildx build --debug --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -t shinabr2/sworld-backend:1.3.0 -f apps/backend/Dockerfile .

# Test locally
docker run -p 4000:4000 shinabr2/sworld-backend:1.3.0
