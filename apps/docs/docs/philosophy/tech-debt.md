# Tech debt

Here are some questions to think about for tech debt, basically the situation determination.

- What happens if I don't do that?
- Is it regarding the data? If so, it's important.
- Does it block the user behavior? If so, it's important.
- Does it annoying to do daily tasks? If so, it needs to be fixed as soon as possible.
- Do I want to fix it just because I want to satisfy my feeling about clean code? If so, create an issue and do later.
