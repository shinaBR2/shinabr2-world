The first site I want to implement is a music site. I will check out the UI from these repositories:

- https://github.com/Aman-Mandal/groovy

List of features:

- Authentication
- Homepage which lists some songs and I can listen
- Admin page since I can config which songs can be displayed on the home page
- Playlist page

The next thing is the main home page for all sites, some inspirational resources:
